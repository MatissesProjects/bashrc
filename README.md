# bashrc
These are my current bashrc settings

This requires a bash_aliases line in the bashrc of linux

## bash_aliases
Houses aliases and quick modifications to the bash profile

## bash_functions
Houses all useful functions

## bash_profile
Houses the pointers to the other files, and does console success and failure coloring.
