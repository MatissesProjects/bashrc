# bashrc
These are my current bashrc settings

For mac I have decided that it is best to separate the logic out into different files

## bash_aliases
Houses aliases and quick modifications to the bash profile

## bash_functions
Houses all useful functions

## bash_profile
Houses the pointers to the other files, and does console success and failure coloring.
